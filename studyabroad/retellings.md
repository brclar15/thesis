#Retellings of the *Iliad* and the Epic Cycle

Brian Clark, '15

***

## Overview of the Epic Cycle ##



- Traditional stories that complete the story of the Trojan War
- Later codified in six epics 
- What survives are quotations, testimonia, and  **retellings**


***

## Sources for retellings ##


- Proclus [Summaries](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA006RN-0007) from the Venetus A
- John Tzetzes [*Homeric Allegories*](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b520005627/f22.zoom.r=.langFR)
- [Hypothesis](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500995q/f9.zoom.r=grec%202706.langFR) of events that precede the *Iliad*
- Apollodorus' *Library*

## Unique Source ##

- [Tabula Capitolina](http://shot.holycross.edu/eikon/tabulaeiliacae/Capitoline_1.jpg)
     - house in the Capitoline Museum
     - photography done by Nik Churik, Rebecca Finnigan during the Spring '14 semester at Loyola Rome

# Aims & Goals#



- see the use of traditional stories in different genres across time
- understand better how retellings can evoke meaning through:
    - selection of multiforms
    - compressed reference to identifying features



----

# Methods #


- look at these retellings in relation to each other, while preserving their integrity
- examine how each breaks their work into episodes
- compare these episodes across the various retellings
- digital diplomatic editions to represent the original form of each retelling

***

## Editing the Tabula Capitolina ##

- far too complex for a print edition -  Inscriptiones Graecae
- digital edition allows for better usability and a more faithful representation
- diplomatic edition represents what survives on the stone 



***


#What is an episode?#

- recognizable unit of narrative action
- divided 
    - linguistically: e.g., μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα in Proclus
    - pictorially:  e.g., orientation of figures and architecture
    - thematically: e.g., characters, geography, or a major event
