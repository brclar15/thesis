Some things we should start keeping notes on:

- bibliography:  anything you read or catch references to.  As you read
things, write a short abstract.  For references, group by access:  things
we need to ILL, links to online things, etc.


Things to Do
- Reread Prolegomena in ML West
- sort through bundle of Google Books
- Photius
- Chrestomathy
- ~~Sort through extrailiadic repository~~ and validate it
- Start collecting for Athenaeus
- Tablua Iliaca
- Aristotle's Poetics
- ILL Severyns books
- move all sources into bibliography


## Possible Big Questions ##
- When do the scholia cite the Epic Cycle?
  * look at Epic echo passages
  * look at scholia of infrequent / unmentioned Epic characters
- Where is the overlap between Apollodorus and the Proclus summaries?
  * Where are the gaps? Where do other sources fill out the mythology?
- How and when does Athenaeus use the Epic Cycle?
- What do the Tabulae Iliacae represent and how are they connected?
