Some things we should start keeping notes on:

- bibliography:  anything you read or catch references to.  As you read
things, write a short abstract.  For references, group by access:  things
we need to ILL, links to online things, etc.


Things to Check
- Reread Prolegomena in ML West
- sort through bundle of Google Books
- Photius
- Chrestomathy
- Sort through extrailiadic repository and validate it
- Start collecting for Athenaeus
- Tablua Iliaca
- Aristotle's Poetics
