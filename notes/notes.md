Some things we should start keeping notes on:

- bibliography:  anything you read or catch references to.  As you read
things, write a short abstract.  For references, group by access:  things
we need to ILL, links to online things, etc.


Things to Do
- ~~Reread Prolegomena in ML West~~
- ~~sort through bundle of Google Books~~
- Photius
- Chrestomathy
- ~~Sort through extrailiadic repository and validate it~~
- Start collecting sources for Athenaeus
- Collect Sources for Tablua Iliaca
- Aristotle's Poetics - see what's there
- ILL Severyns books
- move all sources into bibliography
- Clean up Athenaeus edition (later books)
- Start reading later books of Athenaeus in English
- Diplomatic edition of Allen's Chrestomathy


## Possible Big Questions ##
- How do those quoting and those summarizing deal with Trojan material?
- When do the scholia cite the Epic Cycle?
  * look at Epic echo passages
  * look at scholia of infrequent / unmentioned Epic characters
- Where is the overlap between Apollodorus and the Proclus summaries?
  * Where are the gaps? Where do other sources fill out the mythology?
- How and when does Athenaeus use the Epic Cycle?
- What do the Tabulae Iliacae represent and how are they connected?
