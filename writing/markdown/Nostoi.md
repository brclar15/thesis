The transitions within Proclus' summary of the *Nostoi* are not as evident as in the summaries of the other poems. Only two temporal transitions are used in 

(<code
concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4036.tlg023:Nostoi.5.1-5.2</code>),

where we read

<strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">μεθ᾽ οὓς</strong>,

and, if the reader follows West's addition of "ἔπει" in
(<code
concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4036.tlg023:Nostoi.10.1</code>),

which would make <strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">τὰ</strong> into ἔπειτὰ. 
An explantion for the missing episode distinctions is that the poem would have naturally fallen into seperate episodes as the poet switched between narrating each different group of heroes' journeys. Many of the Greek kings traveled home from Troy not only with their men, but also with other kings. Because each of these groups took seperate routes, the reader finds transitions when Proclus changes his focus. Beyond simply looking for a new character in the nominative case, a reference to a group of ships or to "the ones around" a particular hero mark transitions. This can be seen in

(<code
concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4036.tlg023:Nostoi.5.6-5.8</code>), where we read 
<strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">μετα πέντε. νεῶν </strong>,
(<code
concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4036.tlg023:Nostoi.6.1-6.8</code>), where we read 
<strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">οἱ δὲ περὶ Κάλχαντ καὶ Λεοντέα καὶ Πολυποίτην</strong>,
and (<code
concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg4036.tlg023:Nostoi.7.1-7.5</code>), where we read 
<strong
concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">τὸν δὲ περὶ τὸν Ἀγαμέμνονα</strong>.
