#Chapter 2: The Sources of the Epic Cycle#

This thesis is by no means an exhaustive analysis of the Epic Cycle. With the exception of the Tabula Capitolina, I have restricted myself to literary sources. While it is often complicated to link ancient artwork directly to these epics, there are numerous vase paintings that depict Cyclic episodes [see Davies for the difficulties in dating ktl]. I have worked exclusively with the Tabula Capitolina due to its state of preservation as well as time constraints. My research also does not make use of all of the literary sources. It would have been difficult to extrapolate whole episodes based off of testimonia from other authors[see West for a list of testimonia]. The Homeric scholia alone provide a great deal of insight into the Cycle. The sources that I did choose to work with were chosen for a variety of reasons, such as their authoritative nature or the availability of open access to primary sources documents. 

The Proclus summaries are one of the most essential sources of what is known about the Epic Cycle. Each summary lists the title of the epic, a proposed author, the number of books, as well as the work's sequence   in the Cycle. In their original state, they were part of his work entitled the *Chrestomathy*. Beyond these summaries, our knowledge of this larger work comes from its entry in the *Bibliotheca* of Photius. During the ninth century, Photius was the patriarch of Constantinople. This work is a collection of summaries of book that he had read. The entry for Proclus' *Chrestomathy* says that this work contained biographies of the great epic poets, an account of the Epic Cycle, and a discussion of the *Cypria*[West and Monro]. There is little evidence with which to identify which Proclus is meant here. While he previously had been thought to be the fifth century Neoplatonist, scholars today reject that notion. The most one can deduce is that he may be from the second century(Monoro article, West). Regardless of the difficulties in identifying him, the summaries are invaluable to studying the Epic Cycle. 

These summaries provide a chronological retelling of the Cyclic events not covered in the surviving Homeric epics. Proclus does not include alternate mythological traditions, but rather writes a continuous narrative.  His summaries span the whole Epic Cycle, covering the *Cypria*, *Aithiopis*, *Iliasparva*, *Iliupersis*, and the *Telegonia*. He omits the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, due to their popularity and prevalence at his time. There was no need to retells these two epics, as they were readily accessible and well known at whatever time when Proclus was writing.

The only manuscript source for these summaries, as well as a *Life of Homer* also taken from the *Chrestomathy*, is the Marciana 454 manuscript known as the Venetus A. It is a tenth century deluxe edition of the *Iliad* with extensive scholia which date back to the Library of Alexandria. The Proclus' summaries and the *Life* appear at the front of the codex, except for the summary of the *Cypria*, which is lost. Furthermore, these initial folios are not in their original state or order. A number of blank folios have been sewed to these loose folios when the codex was rebound, which disrupted the standard quaternion layout at this part of the manuscript[See Monro for a reconstruction of the original layout with the Cypria]. 

Although lost from the Venetus A, the summary of the *Cypria* is preserved in four?CHECK manuscripts. It is also the only Proclus summary that appears outside of the Venetus A. The edition of this summary was done from the Escorial 513 Omega 1.12. The Omega 1.12 is an eleventh century manuscript of the *Iliad* with scholia, as well as the *Batrachomyomachia*.
