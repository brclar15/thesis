#Chapter 2: The Sources of the Epic Cycle#

This thesis is by no means an exhaustive analysis of the Epic Cycle. With the exception of the Tabula Capitolina, I have restricted myself to literary sources. While it is often complicated to link ancient artwork directly to these epics, there are numerous vase paintings that depict Cyclic episodes [see Davies for the difficulties in dating ktl]. I have worked exclusively with the Tabula Capitolina due to its state of preservation as well as time constraints. My research also does not make use of all of the literary sources. It would have been difficult to extrapolate whole episodes based off of testimonia from other authors[see West for a list of testimonia]. The Homeric scholia alone provide a great deal of insight into the Cycle. The sources that I did choose to work with were chosen for a variety of reasons, such as their authoritative nature or the availability of open access to primary sources documents.
