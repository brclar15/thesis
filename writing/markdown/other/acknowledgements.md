##Acknowledgements##

I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Smith, for the help and support with this project. Beyond planting the initial idea for this study, his guidance helped it develop into the final product. It is thanks to his clear passion for manuscripts of ancient texts that I found two of my main sources, John Tzetzes' *Homeric Allegories* and a hypothesis to the *Iliad*. After studying Greek under him for two years, and doing research on the Homer Multitext project with him for four, it was a delight to be able to work on such an in-depth project with him. I would also like to thank many of my classmates. Collaboration is a large part of digital research, and this thesis is indebted to many. During their semester abroad in Rome, Nik Churik and Rebecca Finnigan both took photography of the Tabula Capitolina, which figures prominently in my work. Additionally, Rebecca helped me with various editing work on my various editions. Drew Virtue digitally altered these photographs in order to make the text on the stone drastically more legible, which proved to be invaluable. Melody Wauke and Claude Hanely both spent countless hours editing a number of texts that I incorporated into my thesis. Their completely voluntary contribution allowed me to reach a higher level of accuracy on my editions. All of these colleagues have my deep gratitude for both the time they contributed as well as the enjoyment that they added to my work.
