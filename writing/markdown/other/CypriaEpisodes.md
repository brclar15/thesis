#Cypria Episodes#
##Proclus Summary, Apollodorus, Hypothesis, John Tzetzes##

The events that would have appeared in the *Cypria* would have began with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and the judgment of Paris. From there, Paris takes Helen from Sparta back to Troy, causing the Greek forces to rally. After much delay and other exploits, they arrive at Troy and take the beach. The quarrel that opens the *Iliad* would have been found at the very end of the *Cypria*, once the Greeks had sacked an number of surrounding cities.

The sources mentioned above offer retellings of these events. Whether or not they were originally meant to retell Cyclic material is open to debate. However, they all begin with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and end with Agamemnon taking Briseis from Achilles. Therefore, I have analyzed them together with the aim of finding the common episodes in each. In addition, this study revealed not only many differences within these episodes, but also a number of added or omitted episodes in certain retellings. Originally, I had planned to compare each of the episodes in order across all of the retellings. This soon became fruitless because the same episode does not always maintain its narrative sequence in other retellings. Instead, I have followed the episodic distinctions from Proclus' summaries and compared them to the corresponding passages in the other retellings. Any deviation from my previous break down of these episodes from Proclus will be explained in full. 

As mentioned above, each work opens with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. The essential elements of the story are that, during the wedding, Eris creates a contest based on beauty between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Zeus then orders Hermes to escort the goddesses to Mt. Ida, where Paris judges Aphrodite to be the winner because she promised to give him the most beautiful women. 

In a more expanded form, Tzetzes, the hypothesis, and Apollodorus all place the wedding on Mt. Pelion, although this fact is given outside of the sections of Apollodorus that correspond to the Epic Cycle. These same sources mention the famous apple that Eris threw into the wedding, which is described as golden in the hypothesis and by Tzeztes. The location of the wedding and the physical representation of the strife are not essential to the episode. These sources also name not only the gift promised by Aphrodite, as all do, but also the gifts that Paris spurned from Hera and Athena. Though more poetically described by Tzeztes, these gifts are identical: an expansive kingdom, and military might. The promise of Helen is a vital element to this episode because it is what convinces Paris to favor Aphrodite. The hypothesis simply says that she promised τὴν καλλίστην γυναῖκα, while the other retellings directly name Helen.[West on a possible scene of introducing Helen]. Only the hypothesis explains the role of both Hermes and Paris by saying that Zeus did not want to judge the goddesses himself. 

Proclus and Apollodorus both offer an explanation for this event that caused the Trojan War to erupt. They both ascribe it to the will of Zeus. In Proclus, Zeus βουλεύεται μετὰ τῆς Θέμιδος/Θέτιδος  [ftnote on the manuscript and papyri] to bring about the war. Apollodorus writes that it is κατὰ βούλησιν Διός that Helen become famous for causing a war between Europe and Asia. Alternatively, he relates that others claim it is to exalt the race of demigods. This mention of the will of Zeus is not only unique shared between these two sources, but also echoes *Iliad* 1.5, which says that the death and destruction fulfilled Διὸς βουλή. [discuss scholion?]

While one could count Paris' journey to and from Sparta as a single episode based on the uniqueness of its characters and location, Proclus divides it into three separate episodes. His voyage there, his stay at Sparta, and his and Helen's return all receive separate attention. I have fused what I would normally consider two episodes into one from Paris' stay at Sparta. It is likely that Proclus used his typical καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα divider in this instance to show the escalation of Paris' actions before and after Menelaus' departure. 

The first episode is a minor one in which the only essential action is Paris' travel by sea. Excluding Proclus, all of the retellings name Phereclus as the builder of his ships [reference Iliad passage and family names]. The reminder of Proclus' elements seem to be unique. He writes that Aphrodite compels Aeneas to travel with Paris, while the hypothesis merely that he goes ἑταίρους ἀθροίσας. Further, no other retelling offers the warnings of Helenus and Kassandra at this point in the narrative. These Trojan seers give a number of admonishments, but never directly before Paris leaves for Sparta. Kastor and Pollux also do not feature in any retelling except for Proclus. The inclusion of this material would have served to explain their absence from the action of the *Iliad*[cite Iliad 3]. However, it appears to be a highly optional element, as it is strictly limited to Proclus' retelling. 

The episode at Sparta is marked by Paris visiting Helen and Menelaus, and then while his host is away for a burial in Crete, the Trojan prince makes off with both his wife and his property. [κτηματα or χραματα?]. The theft of this property is a small, but crucial element because it plays a role in the embassy to Troy later on in the narrative. Across the various retellings, all except Tzetzes stress the guest-host relation of Paris and Menelaus. In both the hypothesis and Apollodorus, Paris ξενισθεὶς(δὲ) παρὰ Μενελάῳ. In Proclus, Menelaus instructs Helen to look after the ξένοις. This fairly common element stresses the severe affront offered to the host Menelaus by his guest Paris. Tzetzes and Apollodorus add two separate characters to this episode. In his retelling, Apollodorus writes that Helen abandons her nine year old daughter Hermione. She is alluded to in the *Iliad*, but does not play a significant enough role to be vital to this episode[Iliad 3]. Tzeztes notes that Aethra goes with Helen to Troy. Here Tzetzes is alluding to an episode that is mentioned in the *Iliupersis* [Iliad 3 and Sack of Troy]. . However, like Hermione, the figure of Aethra is not central to Helen's departure. 

The question of Helen's willingness to leave with Paris has been a subject of much debate since antiquity [cite Herodotus?]. The hypothesis, Tzetzes, and Apollodorus all use a form of the verb ἁρπάζω, or ἀφαρπάζω in the case of Tzeztes, to describe how Paris carried off Helen. The harsh connotation of this verb shows her unwillingness to leave her husband and home land. Tzetzes talks of Paris as being struck with love, but does not give his readers any insight into the emotional state of Helen. The hypothesis says that δόλω καὶ ἀπάτη φαίνεται τὴν Ἑλένην ἁρπάσας. The trick and deceit that Paris employs supports a forceful rape of Helen. However, Proclus' version tells a different side. He writes that Aphrodite brings the two together, and that they make love before leaving Sparta [cite Iliad 3]. This shows their flight in a different light, one that is not reflected in the other retellings.
