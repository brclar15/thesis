#Retellings of Events Before the *Iliad*#
##Proclus Summary, Apollodorus, Hypothesis, John Tzetzes##

The events that would have appeared in the *Cypria* would have began with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and the judgment of Paris. From there, Paris takes Helen from Sparta back to Troy, causing the Greek forces to rally. After much delay and other exploits, they arrive at Troy and take the beach. The quarrel that opens the *Iliad* would have been found at the very end of the *Cypria*, once the Greeks had sacked an number of surrounding cities.

The sources mentioned above offer retellings of these events. Whether or not they were originally meant to retell Cyclic material is open to debate. However, they all begin with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and end with Agamemnon taking Briseis from Achilles. Therefore, I have analyzed them together with the aim of finding the common episodes in each. In addition, this study revealed not only many differences within these episodes, but also a number of added or omitted episodes in certain retellings. Originally, I had planned to compare each of the episodes in order across all of the retellings. This soon became fruitless because the same episode does not always maintain its narrative sequence in other retellings. Instead, I have followed the episodic distinctions from Proclus' summaries and compared them to the corresponding passages in the other retellings. Any deviation from my previous break down of these episodes from Proclus will be explained in full. 

As mentioned above, each work opens with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. The essential elements of the story are that, during the wedding, Eris creates a contest based on beauty between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Zeus then orders Hermes to escort the goddesses to Mt. Ida, where Paris judges Aphrodite to be the winner because she promised to give him the most beautiful women. 

In a more expanded form, Tzetzes, the hypothesis, and Apollodorus all place the wedding on Mt. Pelion, although this fact is given outside of the sections of Apollodorus that correspond to the Epic Cycle. These same sources mention the famous apple that Eris threw into the wedding, which is described as golden in the hypothesis and by Tzeztes. The location of the wedding and the physical representation of the strife are not essential to the episode. These sources also name not only the gift promised by Aphrodite, as all do, but also the gifts that Paris spurned from Hera and Athena. Though more poetically described by Tzeztes, these gifts are identical: an expansive kingdom, and military might. The promise of Helen is a vital element to this episode because it is what convinces Paris to favor Aphrodite. The hypothesis simply says that she promised τὴν καλλίστην γυναῖκα, while the other retellings directly name Helen.[West on a possible scene of introducing Helen]. Only the hypothesis explains the role of both Hermes and Paris by saying that Zeus did not want to judge the goddesses himself. 

Proclus and Apollodorus both offer an explanation for this event that caused the Trojan War to erupt. They both ascribe it to the will of Zeus. In Proclus, Zeus βουλεύεται μετὰ τῆς Θέμιδος/Θέτιδος  [ftnote on the manuscript and papyri] to bring about the war. Apollodorus writes that it is κατὰ βούλησιν Διός that Helen become famous for causing a war between Europe and Asia. Alternatively, he relates that others claim it is to exalt the race of demigods. This mention of the will of Zeus is not only unique shared between these two sources, but also echoes *Iliad* 1.5, which says that the death and destruction fulfilled Διὸς βουλή. [discuss scholion?]

While one could count Paris' journey to and from Sparta as a single episode based on the uniqueness of its characters and location, Proclus divides it into three separate episodes. His voyage there, his stay at Sparta, and his and Helen's return all receive separate attention. I have fused what I would normally consider two episodes into one from Paris' stay at Sparta. It is likely that Proclus used his typical καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα divider in this instance to show the escalation of Paris' actions before and after Menelaus' departure. 

The first episode is a minor one in which the only essential action is Paris' travel by sea. Excluding Proclus, all of the retellings name Phereclus as the builder of his ships [reference Iliad passage and family names]. The reminder of Proclus' elements seem to be unique. He writes that Aphrodite compels Aeneas to travel with Paris, while the hypothesis merely that he goes ἑταίρους ἀθροίσας. Further, no other retelling offers the warnings of Helenus and Kassandra at this point in the narrative. These Trojan seers give a number of admonishments, but never directly before Paris leaves for Sparta. Kastor and Pollux also do not feature in any retelling except for Proclus. The inclusion of this material would have served to explain their absence from the action of the *Iliad*[cite Iliad 3]. However, it appears to be a highly optional element, as it is strictly limited to Proclus' retelling. 

The episode at Sparta is marked by Paris visiting Helen and Menelaus, and then while his host is away for a burial in Crete, the Trojan prince makes off with both his wife and his property. [κτηματα or χραματα?]. The theft of this property is a small, but crucial element because it plays a role in the embassy to Troy later on in the narrative. Across the various retellings, all except Tzetzes stress the guest-host relation of Paris and Menelaus. In both the hypothesis and Apollodorus, Paris ξενισθεὶς(δὲ) παρὰ Μενελάῳ. In Proclus, Menelaus instructs Helen to look after the ξένοις. This fairly common element stresses the severe affront offered to the host Menelaus by his guest Paris. Tzetzes and Apollodorus add two separate characters to this episode. In his retelling, Apollodorus writes that Helen abandons her nine year old daughter Hermione. She is alluded to in the *Iliad*, but does not play a significant enough role to be vital to this episode[Iliad 3]. Tzeztes notes that Aethra goes with Helen to Troy. Here Tzetzes is alluding to an episode that is mentioned in the *Iliupersis* [Iliad 3 and Sack of Troy]. . However, like Hermione, the figure of Aethra is not central to Helen's departure. 

The question of Helen's willingness to leave with Paris has been a subject of much debate since antiquity [cite Herodotus?]. The hypothesis, Tzetzes, and Apollodorus all use a form of the verb ἁρπάζω, or ἀφαρπάζω in the case of Tzeztes, to describe how Paris carried off Helen. The harsh connotation of this verb shows her unwillingness to leave her husband and home land. Tzetzes talks of Paris as being struck with love, but does not give his readers any insight into the emotional state of Helen. The hypothesis says that δόλω καὶ ἀπάτη φαίνεται τὴν Ἑλένην ἁρπάσας. The trick and deceit that Paris employs supports a forceful rape of Helen. However, Proclus' version tells a different side. He writes that Aphrodite brings the two together, and that they make love before leaving Sparta [cite Iliad 3]. This shows their flight in a different light, one that is not reflected in the other retellings. 

Next, Menelaus finds out about Helen's departure and musters the Greek forces. This episode, through relatively brief, is fairly varied throughout the different retellings. Proclus' account has the most unique elements. After learning of the events from Iris, Menelaus goes first to Agamemnon to plan the expedition, and then to Nestor who relates four mythological stories to him. The stories, as related by Proclus, focus on Eopopeus, Oedipus, the madness of Heracles, and Theseus and Ariadne [see West on these]. Apollodorus has Menelaus simply go to Agamemnon, but then mentions the oath of Tyndareus that all the suitors swore [earlier Apollodorus], which is the only reference to this element in any of these retellings. Furthermore, he issues a warning for all Greek men to be wary of their wives. This can be seen as a foreshadowing on Apollodorus' part of the demise that Agamemnon will meet at the hands of his own wife and her lover [cite Apollodorus part]. The hypothesis does not focus on Menelaus recognition of the rape of Helen, but rather talks of how ἡ τῆς ἁρπαγης φήμη διεδόθη κατὰ τὴν Ἑλλαδα. He goes on to state that the Greeks went to war because it seemed good to the Pythia. This early reference to the Delphic Oracle or her involvement with the Trojan War is not known in any other sources. Tztzes as well does not focus on Menelaus, but rather on the Greeks as a whole. He writes that they sent καὶ γράμματα καὶ πρέσβεις to the Trojans asking for Helen and the property to be returned. These embassies will be discussed later on in this chapter, as they occur after the landing at Troy in Proclus' retelling. This episode is a clear example of how a brief element can be expanded and changed according to the will and intent of the author. 

Within gathering the Greek forces, several retellings include the story of Odysseus' recruitment. A group of Greeks, including Palamedes, went to Ithaca to enlist Odysseus. However, he feigned madness out of a desire to avoid the war. The language of Proclus, μαίνεσθαι προσποιησάμενον, closely matches that of Apollodorus, προσποιεῖται μανίαν. Realizing the trick, Palamedes snatched Telemachus (from the breast of Penelope, according to Apollodorus) and made as if to kill him, thereby forcing Odysseus to drop his act. These events are treated as a distinct episode by Proclus and Apollodorus, but do not appear in either the hypothesis or Tzetzes. It can be seen as an element of the more general episode of mustering the Greek forces. The author of the hypothesis did not feel it was important to include individual recruitments, but was satisfied with merely saying that all the Greeks went to war. The character of Palamedes does not appear at any point of the hypothesis. John Tzetzes felt a great connection with Palamedes, and for this reason may not have wished to portray him acting aggressively towards the hero Odysseus [cite something]. The connection between Palamedes and John Tzetzes will be discussed later in this chapter. 
**talk about the death of Palamedes**

The first gathering at Aulis appears to be an important episode based largely on the involvement of Kalchas. His presence is closely tied to Aulis in all of the retellings, no matter how brief. The hypothesis mentions that he was the leading seer among the Greeks. The other retellings all cite his prophecy of the sparrows and the snake [cite Iliad 2]. The inclusion of this element across all four retellings is what solidifies Aulis as its own episode, as opposed to being merely an element of another episode. Aulis serves as an example of how the presence of one specific element can create an distinct episode. The importance of this prophecy is made evident in its inclusion in the *Iliad*. It foretold the length of the Trojan war, and provides authority to the prophetic skill of Kalchas. 

Next, the Greeks land at Teuthrania and attack it because they think it is Troy. After Telephus, the king of Mysia, kills Thersander, he is wounded by Achilles. Then, a great storm disperses the Greek forces, bringing Achilles to Skyros, where he marries Deidamea, the  daughter of Lycomedes. This episode seems to be made up of elements that are only loosely connected based off of what one can tell from Proclus' retelling. Due to the abbreviated nature of his writings and the fact that these events are not sequential or even sometimes present in other retellings, it is difficult to see what connection Proclus would have created between the elements of this episode. Although he does use his usual episode marker ἔπειτα before and after this section, what comes after is still related to Telephus. Had the events at Skyros not been placed in between the passages concerning Telephus, the singular appearance of Telephus in the Cycle would have made these passage one episode. Still, the inclusion of Achilles' trip to Skyros and the attack on Teuthrania in the same episode, going off of Proclus' temporal episodic dividers, is enough to let them stand as the same unit. 

However, taking this episode as a whole presents problems when looking at the retellings other than Proclus. Not only are they not sequentially linked anywhere else, but they do not even appear in the hypothesis. It is completely silent on both the attack on Teuthrania and Achilles' stay at Scyros. There are a number of possible explanations for its exlusion. It is out of this union that Neoptolemos is born [see Little Iliad and Sack of Troy parts], who plays a large part in the Trojan War after the events of the *Iliad*. However, this is a hypothesis of the *Iliad*, and therefore does not concern itself with the events after this epic. There is no need to foreshadow later Cyclic events, as the hypothesis solely sets out to tell the essential events before the *Iliad*. An analysis of the geographic names present in this retelling reveals that very few of the stops that the Greek forces made on the way to Troy are named. Only Aulis and Lemnos, in connection with Philoctetes, appear in the hypothesis. The author did not concern himself with each side journey, but rather glosses over much of the voyage to Troy. His focus is to set the scene for the *Iliad*, not to give every detail of the journey. 

Apollodorus provides a characteristically expanded version of the attack on Teuthrania. He does include, like Proclus and Tzetzes, that it was the death of Thersander, son of Polynices, that spurred Achilles to confront Telephus one on one. However, Apollodorus explains the details of the wound that Achilles inflicted on Telephus, namely that he tripped with his foot entangled in a vine branch. The wound is important because it figures prominently in the following episode with Telephus.  Tzetzes not only has a fairly contracted retelling of the Telephus episode, but also does not place it in the same narrative sequence as Proclus and Apollodorus. Instead, it is part of a speech given by Palamedes while he is on trial for plotting against the Greeks. A discussion of the character of Palamedes will be given later in this thesis.

The element of the visit to Scyros, as mentioned before, is unique to Proclus when combined with this episode. While the hypothesis is again silent on the event, Apollodorus does retell it in his work. However, it appears in the middle of book 3 as part of a brief section on the early part of Achilles' life[Ap. 3.8.1-3.8.8]. This passage is outside the bounds of Apollodorus' Epic Cycle section, as are events concerning the birth of Paris, and the birth and betrothal of Helen. Apollodorus has Kalchas foretell that Troy would not be taken without Achilles, and consequently Thetis chooses to hide him as a girl in the court of Lycomedes, king of Scyros. Tzetzes makes a highly compressed reference to the events at Scyros, notably not mentioning the place by name or the tryst with Lycomedes' daughter Deidamea. Instead, he writes that Chiron, the centaur teacher of Achilles, foretold the two possible outcomes for Achilles in direct speech to Thetis[ὁσὸς υἱὸς ὁ Ἀχϊλλεὺς μένων ἐν τῇ πατρΐδϊ· ἔσεται πολϋχρόνϊος πλὴν ἐκ τῶν ἀδοξούντων· εἰ μετὰ τῶν Ἑλλήνων δὲ κατὰ τῶν Τρώων πλεύσει, ἔνδοξος ἔσται καὶ λαμπρὸς ἀλλὰ σϋντόμως θνήσκει]. Tzetzes does not provide much more information, but says that Thetis hid him out of fear for her sons's life. He writes that φοβεθεὶς τὸν πόλεμον ἐφόρει γϋναικεῖα, καὶ σῢν παρθὲνοις ἱστουργῶν κρϋπτόμενος ὑπῆρχε[Tzetzes Proleg line 438-439]. This passing reference to hiding among young girls evokes the episode of Scyros without explicitly stating it. It is interesting that Tzetzes is so brief in this passage about a younger Achilles, when he devotes a great number of lines to the a discussion of a young Paris[Tzetzes Proleg line 171-213].

After this, the wounded Telephus seeks out the Greeks, particularly Achilles, in order to be healed. Proclus says that he does this κατὰ μαντείαν[Cypria.14], while Apollodorus names Apollo as the one who suggested that ὁ τρώσας ἰατρὸς γένηται[Apollod. Epitome.3.19]. The element of Achilles as the healer is essential to this episode as he was the one who inflicted the original wound. Like the beginning of Telephus' action in the Cycle, the hypothesis does not contain this part of the episode nor does Tzeztes provide much detail beyond a passing reference.

Connected to the healing of Telephus is the sacrifice of Iphigenia. Proclus includes the end of Telephus' involvement with the focal point of the episode because it is Telephus who guides the Greek forces back to Aulis. Here Agamemnon must offer his daughter to Artemis, in order that the Greeks be able to sail on to Troy. Each retelling, again with the exception of the hypothesis, include a version of this episode. Its wide presence supports the fact that it is an essential episode, even though it is not included in the hypothesis.
