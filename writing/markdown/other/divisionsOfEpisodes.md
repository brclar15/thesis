#Chapter 4: Divisions of Episodes Across Various Retellings##


The Homeric epics are complex narratives that not only do not follow a linear progression, but are also full of digressions. Since the other poems of the Epic Cycle grew out of the same oral tradition, it follows logically that they too would have been as complicated. Aristotle acknowledges the complexity of these epics by stating that their plots have produced many tragedies[^1]. Although this argument is often used to cite the failings of the Cyclic poems and to differentiate them from the Homeric epics, Aristotle's view in a sense supports the need to divide these epics into smaller units, such as episodes. 

An episode is a recognizable unit of narrative action. Its contents form a cohesive set that can be isolated from the larger work. When deciding what events constitute a single episode, I have done my best to follow the ancient critic's views [^2].  It is better to err on the side of an episode that is more inclusive, than to break what should be one episode up into several. In his discussion on what narrative changes would destroy a story, Nunlist writes that "... if the other Cyclopes came to Polyphemus' aid in *Odyssey* 9, the escape of Odysseus and his companions would have become very difficult indeed [^3]". He goes on to cite several instances where a change in the fabula[^4] would not affect the outcome of the story. Similarly, the outcome of an episode must be included in the original episode, even if it sparks the subsequent action.

Certain retellings have evident episodic divisions present in text, but this is not always the case. Imposing divisions is a more difficult and interpretative process. One can create episodes based on geographic terms, such as the Greeks attack on Teuthrania, but only if the episode is fairly brief. Conversely, the events that take place at Troy do not by any means form a single episode. One could mark the entire episode as the journey to and from a location, as well as the events that happen on the sight, such as Paris' trip to Sparta and the cities which he sacks on his way back. Yet, poets composed entire epics about solely one leg of a journey, such as the *Odyssey* and the *Nostoi*. Dividing episodes based on characters also proves to be difficult. Characters that show up infrequently and do not remain in focus for very long, such as Penthesilea, can mark their own episodes. But this does not work for more major characters who appear often, or in back to back episodes. A more complex approach is needed to create episodes based off of thematic content. Not only do the combination of location and certain main characters help to create an episode, but also the presence of more minor characters can often indicate an episode. A polythetic approach allows one to view each episode as a unit that fulfills a number of specific criteria, but not necessarily all of them. This approach is useful when comparing episodes across different retellings, as different authors include or exclude certain elements. 

###Proclus###

Within the summaries of the individual epics, Proclus' separates his narrative into distinct episodes with the use of strong transitional adverbs or prepositional phrases, such as ἔπειτα or μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα. In contrast, he uses common connective particles, such as καὶ and δὲ, to continue the narrative within the boundary of an episode. 

The narrative action that appears within the units that are formed by  these phrases support the idea of taking these . For example, the *Cypria* summary offers examples that  form the desired narrative units. For example,  characters that do not appear frequently in this epic, such as Iphigenia, Philoctetes, and Protesilaos, form the center piece of distinct episode [^5]. In accordance with this polytetic approach, the geographic change further supports these units as separate episodes. Iphigenia is sacrificed at Aulis, Philoctetes is abandoned on Lemnos, and Protesilaos fall at the beach of Troy. Additionally, more expanded aspect of a particular action can be contained within an episode. Proclus has placed the recruitment of Odysseus within the episode of the rallying of the Greek commanders [^6]. His involvement is merely one aspect of this wider narrative unit. 

The summary of the *Aithiopis* provides a clear example of the kind of questions that these episodic division set by Proclus raise. Proclus breaks this epic into five episodes, which only coincidentally matches the number of books that he offers[^7]. A close analysis of the events of these episodes reveals that Proclus did not place arbitrary in his summaries, but rather had these divisions already in mind. While all of the action of this epic is intimately connected, each episode centers on a key figure or event. For example, the first episode is devoted to Achilles slaying the Amazonian queen Penthesilea, the second to the Ethiopian Memnon slaying Antilochos, then the deaths of Memnon and Achilles, then the burial of Antilochos with Achilles, and lastly Thetis transporting her son's body. 

These divisions do not always match up exactly with what might be expected. All of Penthesilea's actions are contained in one episode, but the actions of Memnon span two episodes. The ἔπειτα division in *Aithiopis* section 6 comes in between when Memnon slays Antilochus and when he himself falls and is made immortal. Perhaps Proclus viewed the death of Memnon more closely bound to the death of Achilles, as he joined it to this event rather than to the death of Nestor's son. Arguments such as this must be made each time that Proclus' episodes do not align exactly with what one would expect to be an episode. I have largely maintained the integrity of Proclus' divisions, and noted each time that I have stretched his boundaries.
  
However, this not all of Proclus' summaries have these episodic dividers. They are hardly present in the *Nostoi* or the *Iliupersis*, where both only have three clearly marked off episodes. This difference cannot be due to the alleged size of these particular poems, if one is to follow the numbers given by Proclus. While book number does not necessarily correlate to the length of the work as a whole, both poems have the same number of books or more than the others in which episode divisions are present.

A possible explanation for the missing episode distinctions in the *Nostoi* is that the poem would have naturally fallen into separate episodes as the poet switched between narrating each different group of heroes' journeys home. Many of the Greek kings traveled home from Troy with not only their own men, but also with other kings. Because each of these groups took separate routes, the reader finds transitions when Proclus changes his focus. Beyond simply looking for a new character in the nominative case, a reference to a group of ships or to "the ones around" a particular hero marks transitions. If the poem told the complete story of the journey home of a hero or group of heroes, then the change in characters in the summary would be enough to signal a change of episode. Following this logic, the summary of the *Nostoi* is divided into six episodes that deal directly with journeys home, as well two additional episodes at the beginning and end with extra information. 

This theory does not apply to the *Ilioupersis*, which also lacks these linguistic divisions. Proclus appears to place the dispute over the Horse, Sinon's trick, and the bulk of the Greek assault on Troy into one episode. After this, he lists the fate of a small number of Trojans in the next episode, and then concludes the summary with the departure of the Greeks. It is possible that the assault on Troy and the ensuing carnage was covered in rapid succession in the original poem. One can imagine the Greek forces flooding through the city, and the poet panning through the destruction and covering the essential deaths in his own order. If these deaths or captures were happening simultaneously, but in different parts of the citadel, they could be viewed as separate elements of the single episode made up on the Greek assault.  However, events such as the Trojan deliberation over what to do with the Horse and Sinon's ploy to enter Troy seem to belong to independent episodes. The shift in focus, from the Trojans to the Greek camp strongly suggests that these actions ought to be taken separately from the death and destruction at Troy, although Proclus does not separate them. This seems to be the biggest flaw in Proclus' episodic divisions. 

Because the episode dividers are largely logical and present in the summary of Proclus, I have taken them as the main source with which to compare the other retellings against. When these distinctions are not available, like in the *Ilioupersis*, I have followed a similar method of dividing episodes that I have used in the other retellings.  

###Apollodorus###

The retelling of Apollodorus in the *Library* does not possess any linguistic dividers like those of Proclus. His text is a continuous narrative that does not mark the boundaries of any epic or books within a particular epic. Only once in his retelling of the Epic Cycle does he cite one of his sources by name [^8]. The fact that this retelling falls in the epitome, rather than the main work itself, makes it even more difficult to look for divisions of episodes based on linguistic features. The epitome is comprised of two different sources: the Epitoma Vaticana known as Vaticanus 950 and the Sabbaitic fragments known as Sabbaiticus-Hierosolymitanus 366 [^9]. The Epitoma Vaticana "consist[s] of disconnected passages beginning with ὅτι [^10]." These ὅτι passages do help identifying episodic divisions, but are too infrequent to be relied upon heavily[^11].

In order to divide this work into episodes, I have followed a polythetic approach whereby significant characters, events, and geography work to mark a particular episode. Following the definition of episodes as recognizable units, my divisions are what I believe to be logical, cohesive sections of the text. A new episode starts when the main character in focus changes, a new geographic location is reached, or an essential action occurs. It is important not to truncate an episode too early, especially in the text of Apollodorus. He often provides expanded genealogies and backstories, which must be taken together with the main action of the episode. For example, the backstory explaining Penthesilea's involvement in the Trojan war is an element that Apollodorus chose to include within her broader episode [^12]. It is not its own episode because it does not fit logically with the narrative sequence of the retelling. 

Occasionally, Apollodorus includes variant traditions, or multiforms, in his text. I have taken these together with the main action of the episode, as they do not constitute a new episode themselves, but rather a variation on a preexisting episode. The capture of Helen provides an example of this practice of including multiforms, when in addition to have Helen leave with Paris to Troy, Apollodorus also acknowledges that "some say that, according to the will of Zeus, Helen was conveyed secretly by Hermes to Egypt and was given to Proteus, the king of the Egyptians, to guard, and Paris arrived at Troy with a false likeness of Helen having been made out of clouds[^13]". Because Apollodorus does not assert that this event occurred, it does not form its own episode, but rather is a variant element of Paris' actions at Sparta. 

I have largely relied on a combination of these practices while also employing the divisions offered by Proclus to divide the text of the *Library*. When Apollodorus includes a major event that Proclus omits, this action more often than not became an episode that was unique to Apollodorus, or simply not included by Proclus.

###John Tzetzes###

The episodic division in the *Homeric Allegories* are present in two distinct ways. First, he does have several stock phrases, similar to those of Proclus, which he uses to divide up his narrative. As previously mentioned, this work was meant to introduce Empress Irene to Greek culture, and therefore Tzetzes often employs imperative statements aimed at the reader. The imperative is usually μάνθανε, to introduce the new topic, and often paired with the participial μεμάθηκας, to recap what the reader has just learned. He makes frequent use of this when he introduces Homer, separating his race, his time period, and his death[^14]. Tzetzes transitions from his discussion on Homer to the events that precede the *Iliad* with the lines επεὶ λοιπὸν μεμάθηκας καὶ θάνατον Ὁμήρου, μάνθανε τὴν ὑποθισϊν τῆς ὀλης Ἰ̈λϊάδος[^15]. He provides what seems to be a popular version of the Judgment of Paris, and then directly instructs the reader again that ταϋτα φασϊν οἱ ἀμαθῶς λαλοῦντες καὶ νηπίως. τὸ δ’ ἀληθὲς νῧν μάνθανε καλῶς ἠκρϊβωμένως.[^16], where he gives a lengthy backstory on the birth and early life of Paris. From there, he details the wedding of Peleus and Thetis and how it lead to the Judgment, before he switches to a discussion on the apple of Eris with the use of another imperative[^17]. These imperative episodic dividers appear occasionally through the rest of the prolegomena, but are not present for every episode change. The notably appear before and after the various catalogs that Tzetzes provides[^18]. Where his narrative lacks episodic divisions, I have placed them myself in the same way that I have dealt with the text of Apollodorus. Passing references made to characters that have a significant role in other retellings, such as Cycnus or Telephus, are counted for the purpose of comparison, but do not constitute independent episodes. 

###Hypothesis###

The hypothesis of the *Iliad* is the briefest retelling that I have worked with in this research. Although dwarfed by Apollodorus, it too is a continuous, although choppy narrative. With the exception of the Judgement of Paris, which spans about a quarter of the hypothesis, many episodes consist of merely a sentence or two. This brevity sheds great light on what the essential elements to a given episode are, due to the highly contracted nature of this text. In this text, it is largely the personal names that denote different episodes, as the geographic movement is not always state. The closing comments that link the hypothesis to the start of the *Iliad* have been ignored, as they are not narrative action, but rather an explanation of the text. 

###Tabula Capitolina###

As mentioned above, the Tabula Capitolina offers both a visual and textual retelling of the Epic Cycle. I have worked with the textual retelling, which is the stone stele with the prose summary of books 7 through 24 of the *Iliad*, in the same way that I have worked with the text of Apollodorus. Like the *Library*, no episodic divisions are present in the text. I have generally followed the Iliadic book divisions offered Petrain in his work on this document [^19].

The visual aspect of the Tabula Capitolina is highly complex, with many different paths and views open to the reader. The overall stone is divided into separate epics, with the *Iliupersis* occupying the central panel, a band underneath that for the *Aithiopis* and the *Little Iliad* respectively, and then the *Iliad* framing the stone as a whole. *Iliad* 1 is found at the top of the stone, and *Iliad* 13 through 24 are broken up into bands by individual books to the reader's right. In its original form, *Iliad* 2 through 12 would have been depicted in similar divided bands to the reader's left.

Within each epic, the artist has further arranged his scenes into episodes. For the images contained within the carved bands, a number of different elements work to separates the figures into episodes. Architectural structures, such as temples or tombs, often show the division of episodes. For example, the death of Penthesilea is divided by a pillar, perhaps representing the walls of Troy, from the death of Thersites [^20]. Sometimes these structures are merely dividers, but other times they carry more significance. The structure that follows the death of Thersites is not only just an episodic divider, but also implies the fact that Achilles slew Thersites on the tomb of the Amazonian queen. 

Additionally, the orientation of the figures and their spatial proximity often mark different episodes. Figures that are facing each other and interacting, such as Apollo and Hector in *Iliad* 14[^21], clearly belong to the same episode. Conversely, opposing figures show the separation of episodes. The first two episodes of *Iliad* 16 show the arming of Patroclus and an embassy of Phoenix and Diomedes to Achilles[^22]. The opposing figures show that these scenes are distinct, and that the arming of Patroclus did not occur during the embassy. 

Lastly, the captions that accompany many figures identify certain characters as belong to the same episode. When the figures are not able to be identified iconographically, these labels provide more information on the episode. The captions in the band for scenes from *Iliad* 15 not only identify the warriors, but also divide the visual retelling into episodes based on individual fights and deaths [^23]. 

The section devoted to the *Iliupersis* is not divided into bands, but rather a complex aerial view of the Trojan citadel and the surrounding area. Following the narrative order of other retellings, it is best to work from the top to bottom of these scenes. Many of these figures lack captions or are difficult to identify. The episodes are broken up architecturally, with the action inside of the upper courtyard distinct from the action on either side of it[^24]. These outer figures[^25] appear to be extra figures used to augment the scene, but the presence of a caption would render them as more significant parts of the narrative. This occurs outside of the next episode, which again is contained by the walls of another courtyard[^26]. Here, a Greek warrior and woman become Menelaos and Helen when one reads the caption identifying the structure as ιερον Αφροδιτης[^27]. It is possible that these "extra-figures" could shed more light on this retelling if captions that may now be lost were able to be restored.
	
The next figures are found at the lowest level within the citadel[^28]. Again, the captions and spatial layout of these figure help to break them into three separate episodes. They are grouped to the left, to the right, and in the center of the Scaean gate. While the other scenes within a particular courtyard were all one episode, the physical layout of these three episodes suggests that they are to be taken as distinct from one another.

The remainder of the scenes within the *Iliupersis* are fairly evident in their divisions. The sacrifice of Polyxena[^29] is clearly set off from the departure of Aeneas[^30] by a row of ships and other cutting marks [^31]. At first glance, it may appear that there is only one other episode present, which centers on the tomb of Hector[^32]. However, the repetition of Helenus makes it clear that two episodes are placed along this monument. Helenus would not be named twice within the same episode, and therefore the artist of the Tabula is dividing these episodes along separate sides of Hector's tomb.
