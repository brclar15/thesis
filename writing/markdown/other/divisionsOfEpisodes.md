#Chapter 4: Divisions of Episodes Across the Various Retellings#

**NOT ready to be read yet**

The Homeric epics are complex narratives that not only do not follow a linear progression, but are also full of digressions. Since the other poems of the Epic Cycle grew out of the same oral tradition, it follows logically that they too would have been as complicated. Aristotle acknowledges the complexity of these epics by stating that their plots have produced many tragedies  [Poetics 1459a37]. Although this argument is often used to cite the failings of the Cyclic poems and to differentiate them from the Homeric epics, Aristotle's view in a sense supports the need to divide these epics into smaller units, such as episodes. 

An episode is a recognizable unit of narrative action. Its contents form a cohesive set that can be isolated from the larger work. When deciding what events constitute a single episode, I have done my best to follow the ancient critic's views [cite Nunlist].  It is better to err on the side of an episode that is more inclusive, than to break what should be one episode up into several. For example, Nunlist writes that "THING ABOUT THE CYCLOPES AND ODYSSEUS" [citation]. 

Certain retellings have evident episodic divisions present in text, but this is not always the case. Imposing divisions is a more difficult and interpretative process. One can create episodes based on geographic terms, such as the Greeks attack on Teuthrania, but only if the episode is fairly brief. Conversely, the events that take place at Troy do not by any means form a single episode. One could mark the entire episode as the journey to and from a location, as well as the events that happen on the sight, such as Paris' trip to Sparta and the cities which he sacks on his way back. Yet, poets composed entire epics about solely one leg of a journey, such as the *Odyssey* and the *Nostoi*,. Dividing episodes based on characters also proves to be difficult. Characters that show up infrequently and do not remain in focus for very long, such as Penthesilea, can mark their own episodes. But this does not work for more major characters who appear often, or in back to back episodes. A more complex approach is needed to create episodes based off of thematic content. Not only does the combination of location and certain main characters help to create an episode, but also the presence of more minor characters can often indicate an episode. A polythetic approach allows one to view each episode as a unit that fulfills a number of specific criteria, but not necessarily all of them.**Need more about that?** This approach is useful when comparing episodes across different retellings, as different authors include or exclude certain elements. 

##Proclus##

**moved over from proclusEpisodes.md**

Within the summaries of the individual epics, Proclus' separates his narrative into distinct episodes with the use of strong transitional adverbs or prepositional phrases, such as ἔπειτα or μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα. In contrast, he uses common connective particles, such as καὶ and δὲ, to continue the narrative within the boundary of an episode. 

The narrative action that appears within the units that are formed by  these phrases support the idea of taking these . For example, the *Cypria* summary offers examples that  form the desired narrative units. For example,  characters that do not appear frequently in this epic, such as Iphigenia, Philoctetes, and Protesilaos, form the center piece of distinct episode [*Cypria* 15-17]. In accordance with this polytetic approach, the geographic change further supports these units as separate episodes. Iphigenia is sacrificed at Aulis, Philoctetes is abandoned on Lemnos, and Protesilaos fall at the beach of Troy. Additionally, more expanded aspect of an particular action can be contained within an episode. Proclus has placed the recruitment of Odysseus within the episode of the rallying of the Greek commanders [*Cypria* 10]. His involvement is merely one aspect of this wider narrative unit. 

The summary of the *Aithiopis* provides a clear example of the kind of questions that these episodic division set by Proclus raise. Proclus breaks this epic into five episodes, which only coincidentally matches the number of books that he offers[list episode and book numbers for rest, no connection]. A close analysis of the events of these episodes reveals that Proclus did not place arbitrary in his summaries, but rather had these divisions already in mind. While all of the action of this epic is intimately connected, each episode centers on a key figure or event. For example, the first episode is devoted to Achilles slaying the Amazonian queen Penthesilea, the second to the Ethiopian Memnon slaying Antilochos, then the deaths of Memnon and Achilles, then the burial of Antilochos with Achilles, and lastly Thetis transporting her son's body. 

These divisions do not always match up exactly with what might be expected. All of Penthesilea's actions are contained in one episode, but the actions of Memnon span two episodes. The ἔπειτα division in *Aithiopis* section 6 comes in between when Memnon slays Antilochus and when he himself falls and is made immortal. Perhaps Proclus viewed the death of Memnon more closely bound to the death of Achilles, as he joined it to this event rather than to the death of Nestor's son. Arguments such as this must be made each time that Proclus' episodes do not align exactly with what one would expect to be an episode. I have largely maintained the integrity of Proclus' divisions, and noted each time that I have stretched his boundaries [look more into that].
  
However, this not all of Proclus' summaries have these episodic dividers. They are hardly present in the *Nostoi* or the *Iliupersis* [with only 3 in each]. This difference cannot be due to the alleged size of these particular poems, if one is to follow the numbers given by Proclus. While book number does not necessarily correlate to the length of the work as a whole, both poems have the same number of books or more than the others in which episode divisions are present.

A possible explanation for the missing episode distinctions in the *Nostoi* is that the poem would have naturally fallen into separate episodes as the poet switched between narrating each different group of heroes' journeys home. Many of the Greek kings traveled home from Troy with not only their own men, but also with other kings. Because each of these groups took separate routes, the reader finds transitions when Proclus changes his focus. Beyond simply looking for a new character in the nominative case, a reference to a group of ships or to "the ones around" a particular hero marks transitions. If the poem told the complete story of the journey home of a hero or group of heroes, then the change in characters in the summary would be enough to signal a change of episode. Following this logic, the summary of the *Nostoi* is divided into six episodes that deal directly with journeys home, as well two additional episodes at the beginning and end with extra information. 

Yet, even if this conjecture is true, it does not explain the lack of divisions in the *Ilioupersis*.

These separate journeys took place largely simultaneously, which is why Proclus does not rely on temporal transitions. Rather, he models his summary on the poetic narrative, which most likely would have treated an entire *nostos* before moving on to the next.

###Iliupersis###

The focal image is the *Iliupersis*, which uses the city of Troy as its background. The divisions between the episodes stem from their spatial relation to the citadel. The first episode is bounded by the inner courtyard for the temple of Athena. 1. Here, fighting has broken out as the Greeks descend from the Horse. Most notably, Locrian Ajax is dragging Cassandra from the safety of the temple. The artist has clearly grouped these figures together by surrounding them with the set of temple walls.  

Beneath the temple of Athena, another episode is clearly demarcated by the courtyard of the temple of Zeus or the palace of Priam. 2. Neoptolemos is about to slay Priam, while another Greek attempts to drag away Hecuba. A male and female figure lie on the ground, potentially the children of the Trojan king and queen. Just as above, these figures are meant to be grouped together due to their close physical relation. 

The four pairs of figures outside of these courtyards, one on either side of both sidewalls, blur the episodic distinctions. 3. The lack of visible captions for three of them have lead scholars to label these pairs simply as nameless fighters. They do not appear to fit in with the two episodes occurring inside of the courtyards, but perhaps are meant to fill out the scene visually. The fourth pair does not have a label identifying them by name, but rather the nearby structure bears the inscription ΙΕΡΟΝ ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗΣ. 4.  This strongly support the theory that the man and woman in front of the temple are Menelaus and Helen. Two essential figures such as these raise questions about the roles of the other three pairs. Menelaus and Helen could have simply been confused for another pair, if it were not for the inscription that puts them in greater context. 

The final scenes within the citadel are grouped in three different episodes. On the right, Demophon and Acamas lead their grandmother Aethra out of the city, while three Trojan figures flank their escape. 5. The episode on the left depicts Aeneas receiving the household gods from a priest, again alongside three other figures, this time two warriors and a woman. 6. This episode is distinct from the middle episode, not only because of the reappearance of Aeneas, but because it takes place under the Scaean gate. 7. The architecture of the gate serves to separate these three episodes. The action is divided on either side and in between its arches. Here, Aeneas flees the city, accompanied by his family and Hermes. 

Beneath the citadel, four other episodes fill the remainder of the space devoted to the *Iliupersis*. Each episode is clustered around a central object. The tomb of Hector serves as the main object for the scene on the left. However, there are two episodes around this one object. 8 and 9. In the first, a group of Trojans gather along one wall of the tomb, mourning Hector. The inscriptions identify the characters as Andromache, Cassandra, Talthybius, and Helenus. The second scene depicted along the other wall must be a separate episode, due to the duplication of certain characters and the addition of new ones. Here Odysseus speaks with Helenus while Andromache, Hecuba, and Polyxena sit along side of him. The repeated inscriptions bearing the names of Andromache and Helenus show that this episode must be taken separately from the other episode around the tomb of Hector. 10 and 11. 

The episode on the right takes place around the tomb of Achilles, and is spatial separate from the other scenes in this lower section of the portion of the stone dedicated to the *Iliupersis*. 12. Neoptolemos, accompanied by a page, slaughters Polyxena in the company of Odysseus and Chalchas. The placement of this episode on the same level as the episodes around Hector's tomb show that they both take place on the plains of Tory. 

The last episode in the *Iliupersis* is not only spatially separate from the rest of the scenes below the Trojan citadel, but also marked off with a carved line. This marking separates the scenes on the Trojan plain from this scene on the shore. 13. Here Aeneas boards a ship, accompanied by his pilot Misenus and his father carrying the household gods. 

###Aethiopis###

Below the scenes of the *Iliupersis* are two rows of carvings that depict scenes from the *Aethiopis* and the *Little Iliad*. 14. Both rows are incomplete from the damage done to the stone. The break appears to align with the start of a new episode in the row that depicts the *Aethiopis*. The seven episodes within the scenes in this row are mainly separated by architectural structures. These episodes provide examples of the three different ways in which the artist divides his scenes. The first two episodes and the last are divided in such a way that the architectural structure on the right of the figures is meant to be a part of the scene. 15. 16. The next two scenes are separated by the gates of Troy, which is placed in the middle of these episodes. 17. Here, the gates can be taken with both episodes. The second to last episode in this row has Thetis and the Muses mourning Achilles. The artist depicts them grouped around his tomb, as in indication to take all three figures together. 18. These routine divisions cover six of the seven episodes in this row. However, none of these dividers are present between the fourth and fifth episodes. 19. The reader must us the repetition of the name of Achilles in the inscriptions in order to draw their own divisions. Additionally, the reader's knowledge of the Epic Cycle would place the figure of Odysseus in the latter episode, not the former. {++++}Where to place  Achilles' body?{++++}

###Little Iliad###

The row of scenes from the *Little Iliad* begins with a partial episode, due to the damage done to the stone. 20. Paris lays mortally wounded, but his enemy, Philoctetes, is no longer visible. In this row, the artist employs similar techniques to distinguish the episodes within his narrative. The first full episode likely depicts Priam and the Mysian Eurypylus grouped around an altar. 21. The second and third complete episodes are separated by the gates of Troy, much like the death of Memnon and the death of Achilles in the row above. 22. 23. These scenes show the death of Eurypylus by Neoptolemos outside the city and the raid of the Palladium within. The appearance of the Trojan Horse can be taken two ways: that it marks the division between the raid of the Palladium and the Trojan procession, or that it is meant to assume the reader's knowledge of the Cycle in order to make the division on their own. If we assume the second interpretation, its presence reminds the reader that Odysseus and Diomedes brought back the Palladium before entering the Horse. The Trojan Horse then becomes part of the next episode, where it is being led in procession by the Trojan women and Phrygians. 25. Because the figure at the front of the procession and Priam stand with their backs to one another, the episode of the Horse does not include Priam and Sinon. 26. It is difficult to see whether the artist meant for there to be a distinction between the episode of Priam and Sinon and that of Cassandra and her attendant. There is no structure between them, and the two pairs are, while perhaps not intentionally, facing one another. Yet, there is enough space between the pairs to suggest that they may be separate episodes. Turning to the reader's knowledge of the Cycle does not make this matter much clearer. There is significant debate and conflicting evidence as to where the *Little Iliad* ended and the following *Iliupersis* began. The artist's depiction of the *Iliupersis* clearly shows that the Greeks exited the Horse within the narrative bounds of that epic. Yet, the testimonia of these two epics do not agree on when the Greeks left the Horse, and more importantly here the protestation of Cassandra. Due to Cassandra's presence in the depictions of the *Little Iliad*, it would seem that  the artist  intends for this episode to be here. Yet, the question of whether it belongs with the Priam and Sinon episode would diminish its importance, and thus make it possible for an episode solely devoted to Cassandra's protestation to be found at the very beginning of the *Iliupersis*, as Proclus has it. {++++}need to clean that argument up. not sure if it should go here or later in a discussion of episodes that do not align across the sources{++++}


###Iliad 1###

The row about the central portion of the tabula depicts scenes from *Iliad 1*. 27. The carvings are largely intact, except for an additional episode at the start that has been destroyed. With seven of the eight episodes shown, the space dedicated to depicting this book is roughly double the space that is dedicated to retelling the other books of the *Iliad*. Due to their close proximity, it may seem that the first two episodes are in fact one. 28. However, the duplication of Chryses both bringing the ransom for his daughter and then praying at the temple of Apollo makes these two distinct episodes. The temple provides a separation between the episode of the plague. 29. It is clear that the plague and the meeting of the Greek chiefs are independent episodes, but it is not clear where Chalcas belongs. He is addressing the council of the Greeks, and therefore could easily be part of that episode, as Petrain has him. His caption is certainly close enough to the names of the other Greeks. Schreiber has an episode that consists solely of the seer. Yet, the fact that Chalcas is facing the plague, and conversely that his back is turned on the Greeks, is an argument for viewing the plague and the seer as one episode. 30. While he is speaking to the Greek leaders, the focus of his speech is the plague, which he seems to be nearly interacting with. {++++}maybe not the case, if the modern drawings are not as accurate, depending on where his face is pointing{++++} The council of the Greeks, including Athena pulling back Achilles, is depicted as one episode do to the figures being clustered around Agamemnon. Likewise, the group of animals after it start a new episode where Odysseus leads the sacrifice to the temple of Apollo. 31. The artist, as he often does, then separates this episode from the supplication of Zeus by Thetis with the structure of the temple.
