##Chapter 7: Post-Iliadic Retellings: Apollodorus' *Library*, Proclus' Summaries, Tabula Capitolina##

###Aithiopis###

The *Aithiopis* follows the *Iliad* in the narrative sequence of the Epic Cycle. The poem begins with the arrival of the Amazonian queen Penthesilea. After her death, the poem focuses largely on the death and burial of Achilles. It closes with the famous dispute over whether Odysseus or Telamonian Ajax should win Achilles' arms. Proclus' summary of the *Aithiopis*, the corresponding section of Apollodorus' *Library*, and the images found in the band for this epic all aim to retell the events within these narrative bounds. The images from the Tabula have been damaged, and the remaining scenes pick up with the death of Penthesilea. It is difficult to tell how many episodes have been lost in the damage. Given the fact that the scenes for *Iliad* 1 that are found on the top band of the stone begin relatively close to the start of the book, it is likely that only one or two episodes were lost from the *Aithiopis* and from the *Little Iliad*. 

The first episode of this epic centers on Penthesilea. Proclus writes that she came to Troy συμμαχήσουσα[Aithiopis.1]. He provides a brief ancestry for the Amazon saying that she is Thracian by race and a daughter of Ares. She then fights bravely at Troy; Proclus goes as far to say that she ἀριστεύουσαν, before being killed by Achilles. This is echoed in Apollodorus who says that she μάχης γενομένης πολλοὺς κτείνει[Apollod. Epit. 5.1] and includes Machaon among her victims. However, Machaon is alive and well in Proclus' summary of the *Little Iliad*, as he heals Philoctetes[*Little Iliad*.3].  The Tabula only preserves the death of Penthesilea[urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.Capitoline_8@0.006,0.3573,0.13,0.108], not her *aristeia*[Petrain reads κης for Podacres in a caption before the first visible episode, which would show his death at her hands, suggesting her skill in battle]. Even without a visual episode of her slaying her opponents, the mention of Penthesilea is enough to evoke the idea of her prowess and might.   Proclus adds that the Trojans buried her, which  highlights the importance of her figure that this phrase was included in the summary [West 140].Apollodorus  expands the episode as he usually does to provide the back-story as to why Penthesilea came to fight in a war in which she had no stake. He writes that she needed to be purified for killing Hippolyte. Then, Apollodorus gives a history of Hippolyte[Apolld. Epit. 5.2]. However, an almost identical passage occurs in Apollod. Epit. 1.17. Frazer says that the former location is where the passage occurs in the Sabbaitic fragments, and the latter is where it occurs in the Vatican Epitome. 

Another essential element to this episode is the death of Thersites. The troublesome Greek solider from *Iliad* 2 mocks Achilles, and then is killed by him out of rage. This scene is depicted on the Tabula, and the monument on which he is being killed is perhaps the tomb of Penthesilea [urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.Capitoline_8@0.107,0.368,0.158,0.0933]. Apollodorus and Proclus both cite the source of Thersites' mockery was the love of Achilles for the Amazonian queen. Proclus says that it was his λεγόμενον ἔρωτα[*Aithiopis*.3], while Apollodorus strongly states that Achilles ἐρασθεὶς τῆς Ἀμαζόνος[Apollod. Epit. 5.1]. Here we see another instance where Proclus is more cautious and passive, while Apollodorus uses more direct language. Uniquely in Proclus, the death of Thersites causes a στάσις among the Greeks. 

Then, Achilles sails to Lesbos to be purified, according to Proclus. This element to the following episode revolving around Memnon seems to be responding to the στάσις caused above. Since the στάσις is found only in Proclus, so too is the purification of Achilles only in that one retelling. After this, the Ethiopian son of Dawn arrives at Troy. Similar to Penthesilea, he wreaks having on the battle field, and then is killed by Achilles. Proclus says that he arrives ἡφαιστότευκτον πανοπλίαν[*Aithiopis*.5], and Apollodorus says that he comes μετὰ πολλῆς Αἰθιόπων δυνάμεως[Apollod. Epit. 5.3]. This episode is a rare instance where Proclus expands the action more than Apollodorus. Memnon kills Antilochos, the son of Nestor and close friend of Achilles, thus enraging Achilles to the point of slaying Memnon. Proclus notes that καὶ Θέτις τῷ παιδὶ τὰ κατὰ τὸν Μέμνονα προλέγει, presumably that their fates were closely tied and that Achilles would not outlive Memnon by much[West 145]. In Proclus, the death of Antilochos and the death of Memnon are separated by the word ἔπειτα, which usually marks an episodic division. However, due to how closely bound these two events are causally, I have treated them as one episode that deals with Memnon. Proclus ends his episode by having Dawn beg Zeus to grant her fallen son immortality. It is surprising how brief Apollodorus is on this episode, given his preference for back-stories and alternate traditions. The Tabula treats Memnon in one episode, showing his death at the hands of Achilles with the slain Antilochos nearby[urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.Capitoline_8@0.233,0.3667,0.177,0.1].

Following the death of Memnon is the death of Achilles and the retrieval of his body. This episode is divided into two on the Tabula[urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.Capitoline_8@0.396,0.368,0.245,0.1107]. The first shows a fallen Achilles being shielded by Ajax, and the second showing Odysseus fighting and Ajax carrying the body.
