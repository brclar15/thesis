#Intro#

The Tabula Capitolina depicts a broad range of scenes from the Epic Cycle. The central block shows events from the *Iliupersis*. Scenes from *Iliad* 1 fill the top row of the stone, and carvings of the *Aethiopis* and the *Little Iliad* run along the bottom. The right side of the Tabula shows the events of *Iliad* 13 through 24. This layout strongly suggests that scenes from *Iliad* 2 through 12 would have filled the left hand side in the stones original condition.

#Iliupersis#

The focal image is the *Iliupersis*, which uses the city of Troy as its background. The divisions between the episodes stem from their spatial relation to the citadel. The first episode is bounded by the inner courtyard for the temple of Athena. 1. Here, fighting has broken out as the Greeks descend from the Horse. Most notably, Locrian Ajax is dragging Cassandra from the safety of the temple. The artist has clearly grouped these figures together by surrounding them with the set of temple walls.  

Beneath the temple of Athena, another episode is clearly demarcated by the courtyard of the temple of Zeus or the palace of Priam. 2. Neoptolemos is about to slay Priam, while another Greek attempts to drag away Hecuba. A male and female figure lie on the ground, potentially the children of the Trojan king and queen. Just as above, these figures are meant to be grouped together due to their close physical relation. 

The four pairs of figures outside of these courtyards, one on either side of both sidewalls, blur the episodic distinctions. 3. The lack of visible captions for three of them have lead scholars to label these pairs simply as nameless fighters. They do not appear to fit in with the two episodes occurring inside of the courtyards, but perhaps are meant to fill out the scene visually. The fourth pair does not have a label identifying them by name, but rather the nearby structure bears the inscription ΙΕΡΟΝ ΑΦΡΟΔΙΤΗΣ. 4.  This strongly support the theory that the man and woman in front of the temple are Menelaus and Helen. Two essential figures such as these raise questions about the roles of the other three pairs. Menelaus and Helen could have simply been confused for another pair, if it were not for the inscription that puts them in greater context. 

The final scenes within the citadel are grouped in three different episodes. On the right, Demophon and Acamas lead their grandmother Aethra out of the city, while three Trojan figures flank their escape. 5. The episode on the left depicts Aeneas receiving the household gods from a priest, again alongside three other figures, this time two warriors and a woman. 6. This episode is distinct from the middle episode, not only because of the reappearance of Aeneas, but because it takes place under the Scaean gate. 7. The architecture of the gate serves to separate these three episodes. The action is divided on either side and in between its arches. Here, Aeneas flees the city, accompanied by his family and Hermes. 

Beneath the citadel, four other episodes fill the remainder of the space devoted to the *Iliupersis*. Each episode is clustered around a central object. The tomb of Hector serves as the main object for the scene on the left. However, there are two episodes around this one object. 8 and 9. In the first, a group of Trojans gather along one wall of the tomb, mourning Hector. The inscriptions identify the characters as Andromache, Cassandra, Talthybius, and Helenus. The second scene depicted along the other wall must be a separate episode, due to the duplication of certain characters and the addition of new ones. Here Odysseus speaks with Helenus while Andromache, Hecuba, and Polyxena sit along side of him. The repeated inscriptions bearing the names of Andromache and Helenus show that this episode must be taken separately from the other episode around the tomb of Hector. 10 and 11. 

The episode on the right takes place around the tomb of Achilles, and is spatial separate from the other scenes in this lower section of the portion of the stone dedicated to the *Iliupersis*. 12. Neoptolemos, accompanied by a page, slaughters Polyxena in the company of Odysseus and Chalchas. The placement of this episode on the same level as the episodes around Hector's tomb show that they both take place on the plains of Tory. 

The last episode in the *Iliupersis* is not only spatially separate from the rest of the scenes below the Trojan citadel, but also marked off with a carved line. This marking separates the scenes on the Trojan plain from this scene on the shore. 13. Here Aeneas boards a ship, accompanied by his pilot Misenus and his father carrying the household gods. 

#Aethiopis#

Below the scenes of the *Iliupersis* are two rows of carvings that depict scenes from the *Aethiopis* and the *Little Iliad*. 14. Both rows are incomplete from the damage done to the stone. The break appears to align with the start of a new episode in the row that depicts the *Aethiopis*. The seven episodes within the scenes in this row are mainly separated by architectural structures. These episodes provide examples of the three different ways in which the artist divides his scenes. The first two episodes and the last are divided in such a way that the architectural structure on the right of the figures is meant to be a part of the scene. 15. 16. The next two scenes are separated by the gates of Troy, which is placed in the middle of these episodes. 17. Here, the gates can be taken with both episodes. The second to last episode in this row has Thetis and the Muses mourning Achilles. The artist depicts them grouped around his tomb, as in indication to take all three figures together. 18. These routine divisions cover six of the seven episodes in this row. However, none of these dividers are present between the fourth and fifth episodes. 19. The reader must us the repetition of the name of Achilles in the inscriptions in order to draw their own divisions. Additionally, the reader's knowledge of the Epic Cycle would place the figure of Odysseus in the latter episode, not the former. **Where to place  Achilles' body?**

#Little Iliad#

The row of scenes from the *Little Iliad* begins with a partial episode, due to the damage done to the stone. 20. Paris lays mortally wounded, but his enemy, Philoctetes, is no longer visible. In this row, the artist employs similar techniques to distinguish the episodes within his narrative. The first full episode likely depicts Priam and the Mysian Eurypylus grouped around an altar. 21. The second and third complete episodes are separated by the gates of Troy, much like the death of Memnon and the death of Achilles in the row above. 22. 23. These scenes show the death of Eurypylus by Neoptolemos outside the city and the raid of the Paladium within. The appearance of the Trojan Horse can be taken two ways: that it marks the division between the raid of the Paladium and the Trojan procession, or that it is meant to assume the reader's knowledge of the Cycle in order to make the division on their own. 


_____________________________________
The upper row of carvings that depict scenes from {++++}Iliad 1{++++} are similarly divided using structural barriers. Additionally, {==characters with their backs==}{>>use 'their' as a plural pronoun<<} turned to another group clearly shows the boundary of an episode. The right-hand side of the table has scenes from Iliad 13-24. Each book is in a separate block, often with the corresponding book letter. When different episodes appear within the depiction of one book, the separation is again generally shown by having non-linked characters stand back to back. Structural divisions are less common, though not entirely absent. In this section, the captions are also employed to show groupings. Names that are close together correspond to characters that appear in the same episode.
The depictions of the Aethiopis and the Little Iliad are found along the bottom left edge of the table. These carvings make use of all three episode markers. Characters within the same episode are named, often {++with vertical labels}{--in a vertical manner--}.
