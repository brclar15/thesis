##Chapter 3: Editorial Practices##


Throughout this thesis, I have worked in a digital environment. The task of breaking a retelling into episodes and then analyzing these respective episodes across other various retellings is not in itself inherently digital. However, this work method does allow for more precise comparisons to be made. Both my textual editions as well as certain data sets were all done in a digital format in order to make them long-lasting and easily accessible. 

Wherever possible, I have created diplomatic digital editions for my sources by working with digital open access photography. A diplomatic edition is one that seeks to represent faithfully every mark that appears on a page. The purpose of this is to provide an authentic reading of a specific manuscript. In this type of edition, words that seem to be scribal errors are transcribed exactly as they appear, although there is a way to indicate that the editor believes there to be a problem with what the scribe has written. Modern corrections and rules of orthography are not imposed onto the text, thus preserving its integrity and original from. 

Additionally, a diplomatic edition that is done digitally further enhances the usefulness of the edition and improves how faithfully it represents the original. First, it offers a reader of the edition the option of several different viewing options, as opposed to the a the static view offered in a printed edition. Not only can the reader choose to see a purely diplomatic edition, but they also have the freedom to view the same edition with the abbreviations expanded and with other editorial choices resolved. On a more complex level, the reader can also select the order in which to view the text. For example, my editions of the Proclus' summaries from the Venetus A can be viewed in narrative order, or they can be viewed in the order in which they appear in the manuscript. This method gives the reader a better sense of how the original document is composed. 

I have done my editions in Extensible Markup Language (XML) and followed the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines. XML allows my editions to be machine actionable and technology independent. They can be manipulated in a variety of ways and will outlast any website that I use to host them. The TEI guidelines allowed me to create diplomatic editions that match a sophisticated level of scholarship. This style of editing gave me the ability to "tag up" my text with TEI elements that indicate whether a word is a person name, place name, abbreviation, error, or a number of other categories. Rather than attempt to follow every available TEI markup, it has been my practice to adhere to the editorial guide put forth by the Homer Multitext project [link to the editorial guide]. This sets attainable limits on the vast scope of TEI mark up, while still providing a highly diplomatic edition and a usable digital text.
