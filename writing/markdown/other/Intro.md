##Retellings of the Iliad and the Epic Cycle##

#Introduction#

From their genesis to the present day, the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey* have been praised for their poetic and narrative excellence. The few attempts that have been made to recreate these epics have failed to match the product that came from a long standing oral tradition. As these epics became central to both Greek and Roman education, the need arose for shorter, more compact versions of this material to be circulated. However, the length and complexity of these poems made it a difficult task to break them down into smaller units. These summaries, or retellings, are remarkably dense, while still being abbreviated. In an attempt to give only the essential action, many scenes and even whole characters were cut out. This practice of retelling the Homeric epics reveals what were considered the vital parts, or episodes, within these poems. The way in which these retellings are separated into episodes, what is included and excluded, and the characters who appear in them all help to understand how an ancient audience would have read these epics.

In addition to the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, six other epic poems existed in antiquity that filled out the story of the Trojan War. Beginning with the wedding of Peleus and Thetis found in the *Cypria*, and continuing until the death of Odysseus at the hands of his son in the *Telegonia*, these poems became known as the Epic Cycle. Originally oral epics, the poems of the Cycle became codified between the seventh and sixth centuries (West 25-26, Davies 1989). Yet, they never reached the level of fame that the Homeric epics had, and as a result, they ceased to exist in their original complete form somewhere between the third and fifth century (West 25-26). 

These poems do not seem to have been as central to Greek and Roman education as the *Iliad*, or even the *Odyssey* were. Interest in these Cyclic epics was largely due to their thematic connection to the Homeric epics. This is clear from the way in which these Cyclic retellings are often closely paired with Homeric material, as will be explained later. Examples of retellings for not only the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, but also the Epic Cycle as a whole, have survived in various forms, each with a different style and range. 

In the *Chrestomaty*, Proclus wrote summaries of the Epic Cycle, excluding the Homeric poems. These summaries provide a proposed author, number of books, and a brief chronological summary of each work. The sole source for these summaries, excluding the one for the *Cypria* is the Marciana 454 manuscript. The *Cypria* summary has been lost from this manuscript(Monoro article), but is preserved in several other manuscripts, such as the Escorial Omega 1.12.  

The *Bibliotheca*, attributed to a second century Apollodorus, is a lengthy collection of mythological stories, which covers the entire Epic Cycle in a continuous narration. It was most likely written in the first or second century (Frazer into XVI). This text offers variant stories and genealogies, and occasionally attributes them to certain authors. The epitome of this work, which is found in two manuscripts, contains five sections dedicated to the stories that span the Epic Cycle. Unlike Proclus, Apollodorus includes the action of both *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*. 

The Tabula Capitolina, one of about twenty-two stone tables that date to the early Roman period, contains both visual and textual retellings of the Epic Cycle. Although damaged, its original form would have shown carved scenes from the entire *Iliad*, as well as the *Aethiopis*, *Iliasparva*, and the *Iliupersis*. Additionally, two steles would have contained a continuous prose summary of the *Iliad*. After sustaining the damage, the Tabula now depicts scenes from the poems of the Epic Cycle mentioned above, as well as scenes from *Iliad* 1 and 13 through 24. Only the right hand stele remains, which contains the summary of *Iliad* 7 through 24. 

John Tzetzes wrote a work entitled *Homeric Allegories* in the twelfth century in order to introduce the foreign Empress Irene to Greek culture. In the proglegomena, he provides a brief "life of Homer", and then moves on to instruct his reader on the events that occurred before the *Iliad*. This section spans about a thousand lines, and roughly correspond to the events that would have been found in the *Cypria*.  

It has been the aim of this thesis to look at the different retellings of the *Iliad* and the Epic Cycle in conjunction with one another, instead of analyzing one author or genre in isolation. However, the separate works were not used to fill out the text of another, as scholars often do, for example, with Proclus' summaries and the text of Apollodorus. Each work was treated as a single, distinct entity. This allows one to draw conclusions based on the context of the work as a whole, rather than working from an artificial narrative that was created by conflating multiple sources. 

Additionally, it is important to look at these works together because of the incomplete, but overlapping story that they tell. Apollodorus is the only work that covers the entire Epic Cycle; the rest offer a smaller selection. However, the different retellings of the events that correspond to a particular epic provide excellent material for comparison. The varied genres of these works give one the opportunity to see how these retellings work across different styles and media. 

I have divided these works into episodes based on various criteria. Some texts have episodic divisions based on certain phrases or grammatical constructions, such as Proclus' summaries. When these divisions were not as consistent or evident, I created the divisions myself, following the ancient critic's view of episodes as seen in the Homeric scholia (Nunlist). A detailed explanation of my methods will be given in subsequent chapters. Regarding the Tabula, both visual and textual indicators work to create distinct episodes within the artistic narrative. 

Furthermore, primary source documents, such as diplomatic digital editions of manuscripts or inscriptions, form the foundation of this thesis whenever possible. The reason for this approach was to faithfully represent what is found in the original tradition of these works, rather than to correct them in a modern sense that would be foreign to their historical context. This decision and process will be expanded in later chapters.
