## Explanation of episodic divisions within Proclus' Chrestomathy ##

The summaries of the Epic Cycle that are found in Proclus' *Chrestomathy* relate the mythological events that complete the story of the Trojan War. They offer a chronological retelling of the actions not covered in the surviving Homeric epics in a  continuous narrative without the inclusion of alternate mythological traditions. Within his individual summaries, Proclus' seperates the narrative into distnict episodes with the use of strong transitional adverbs or prepositional phrases, such as ἔπειτα or μετὰ ταῦτα. In contrast, he uses common connective particles, such as καὶ and δὲ, to continue the narrative within the boundary of an episode. 
  
However, this trend does not carry over to the *Nostoi* or the *Iliupersis*. This difference cannot be due to the alleged size of these particular poems, if one is to follow the numbers given by Proclus. They are both the same length or longer than other poems where the episode divisions are present. A possible explanation for the lack of division within the *Nostoi* could be that this particular narrative was initially arranged into episodes. If the poem told the complete story of a hero or group of heroes, then the change in characters in the summary would be enough to signal a change of episode. Yet, even if this conjecture is true, it does not explain the lack of divisions in the *Ilioupersis*.
