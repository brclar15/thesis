The Tabula Capitolina depicts scenes from the *Ilioupersis*, *Aethiopis*, *Little Iliad*, and then *Iliad*. The cental image is the *Ilioupersis* over the background of the city of Troy. Each of the episodes is contained within a part of the citadel, with the walls of inner temples serving as dividers. Given the space between the figures, the captions that occasionally appear are used more to label the characters than to seperate episodes.

The upper row of carvings that depict scenes from Iliad 1 are similarly divided using structural barriers. Additionally, a character with thier back turned to another group clearly shows the boundary of an episode. The right-hand side of the table has scenes from Iliad 13-24. Each book is in a seperate block, often with the corresponding book letter. When different episodes appear within the depiction of one book, the seperation is again generally shown by having non-linked characters stand back to back. Structural divisions are less common, though not entierly absent. In this section, the captions are also employed to show groupings. Names that are close together correspond to characters that appear in the same episode.

The depictons of the *Aethiopis* and the *Little Iliad* are found along the bottom left edge of the table. These cravings make use of all three episode markers. Characters within the same episode are named, often in a vertial manner. Several structures further work to divide the scenes. Lastly, characters facing one another are meant to be taken together. 

Additionally, the inscribed stele serves as a division between the *Iliad* and the rest of the Epic Cycle. Due to the lack of book divisions in the summary on the stele and its wider coverage, the text does not correspond to Iliadic episodes found to the right.
