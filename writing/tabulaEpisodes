The Tabula Capitolina depicts scenes from the *Ilioupersis*, *Aethiopis*, *Little Iliad*, and then *Iliad*. The cental image is the *Ilioupersis* over the background of the city of Troy. Each of the episodes is contained within a part of the citadel, with the walls of inner temples serving as dividers. Given the space between the figures, the captions that occasionally appear are used more to label the characters than to seperate episodes.

The upper row of carvings that depict scenes from Iliad 1 are similarly divided using structural barriers. Additionally, a character with thier back turned to another group clearly shows the boundary of an episode. The right-hand side of the table has scenes from Iliad 13-24.
