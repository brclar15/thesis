#Retellings of the *Iliad* and the Epic Cycle

Brian Clark, '15

----------

## Overview of the Epic Cycle ##



- Traditional stories that complete the story of the Trojan War
- Later codified in six epics 
- What survives are quotations, testimonia, and  **retellings**


----------

## Sources for retellings


- Proclus [Summaries](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:vaimg.VA006RN-0007) from the Venetus A
- John Tzetzes [*Homeric Allegories*](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b520005627/f22.zoom.r=.langFR)
- [Hypothesis](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b52500995q/f9.zoom.r=grec%202706.langFR) of events that precede the *Iliad*
- Apollodorus' *Library*

Annotated reliefs:

- [Tabula Capitolina](http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/tomcat/hmt-digital/images?request=GetIIPMooViewer&urn=urn:cite:hmt:capimgs.Capitoline_1)

----------
# Aims & Goals#



- see use of traditional stories in different genres across time
- understand better how retellings can evoke meaning through:
    - selection of multiforms
    - compressed reference to identifying features



----

# Methods #


- look at these retellings in relation to each other, while preserving their integrity
- examine how each breaks their work into episodes
- compare these episodes across the various retellings
- diplomatic digital editions to represent form of retelling

----------


#What is an episode?#

- recognizable unit of narrative action
- divided 
    - linguistically: e.g., μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα in Proclus
    - pictorially:  e.g., orientation of figures
    - thematically:  characters, geography, or a major event


----------


## Three comparisons#

- One from  before the *Iliad* Material
- One from the *Iliad*
- One from after the *Iliad* material

# Summary: treatment of episodes #



- vital episodes vs expanded episodes
- added vs omitted episodes / characters
-  simple elements that tell a wider story
- preferences of the different retellings:  genre, length, and goal

---


# Conclusions #

- retellings present complex multiformity and intertextuality
- vital to understanding highly compressed reuse of traditional material
     - Homeric scholia
